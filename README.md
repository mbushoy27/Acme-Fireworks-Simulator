# Acme-Fireworks-Simulator
Fireworks simulator made for a class assignment. 

To use the simulator, the user must select a color, a firework and input a speed and a launch angle. The user will also need to slide through for a time, which is valued in the equation for projectile.

Overall, the simulator is created through a matrix in a paint component method where the code for each firework is repeated for each new color. 

Enjoy!
